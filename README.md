## Curriculum for learning EDM production

### Introduction

The idea for compiling this curriculum is to provide a structured plan for self taught music producers,
specifically computer musicians.

Music production is a vast subject and it can be overwhelming to learn from scratch. Hopefully this guide will come in
handy for others.

I've listed free and paid resources at the end of each section. I aim to find the best quality free resources,
so that in theory, one could master the subject with limited resources.
